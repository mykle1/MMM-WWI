## MMM-WWI

**Weather Without Icons**

## But Mykle, why another weather module?

I enjoy doing this. I'm not trying to compete with the *real* geniuses here.
They are truly amazing and worthy of praise. I'm just having fun.
I'm still surprised that I can make *any* module work.
That's mostly due to the patience and generosity of my friend at the forum.
He is one of those genius types that I am talking about. :^)

## The information 

* Current conditions, temperature and time
* Conditions for the next hour
* A summary for the next 7 days
* Pictures of lightning events (1-13) if you want them
* Heat index/Wind chill temperature at this moment
* Nearest storm/weather event at this moment
* Bearing of the nearest storm/weather event at this moment
* Wind speed for your location at this moment
